Since I currently don't have any blog posts (or atleast any blog posts that I haven't since deleted due to a disregard for the significance of history) this default jekyll page will have to do.
Suffice to say this website is running on jekyll.
Jekyll is a static website generator.
So I write all my posts and pages in markdown files and Jekyll converts the assortment into navigable html pages.
It integrates with Sass so my CSS is slightly less verbose than normal CSS.
But the best part - probably the only part I care about - is I can manage all my pages as a file heirarchy.

I've spent too long saying wordson a temp blog post.
Here's the default post with pronouns changed since I seem to be a stickler for grammar.

I’ll find this post in my `_posts` directory.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
